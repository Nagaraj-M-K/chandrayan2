                &nbsp; Chandrayaan 2 was India's second lunar exploration mission, launched by the Indian Space Research
                Organization
                (ISRO) with the goal of furthering our understanding of the Moon's surface and its potential resources.
                The
                mission was designed to consist of an orbiter, a lander named Vikram, and a rover named Pragyan. While
                the
                orbiter successfully entered lunar orbit and continues to operate, the lander's attempt to make a soft
                landing
                on the Moon encountered a setback.</p>

            <p>&nbsp; The landing attempt of the Vikram lander took place on September 6, 2019, and it was closely
                watched
                by people
                around the world. Unfortunately, during the final stages of the descent, communication with the lander
                was
                lost,
                and it crashed on the lunar surface. The failure of the landing was a disappointment, but it's important
                to
                recognize that space exploration is challenging and risky, and failures are a part of the learning
                process.

    <p><b>Despite the landing setback, Chandrayaan 2 achieved several important objectives:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>ORBITER SUCSES:</h3>
        </li>
        <p>
            &nbsp; The Chandrayaan 2 orbiter continued to function and is still operational as of my last knowledge
            update in
            September 2021. The orbiter has been sending back valuable data and images of the Moon's surface,
            contributing to our understanding of lunar geology and mineralogy.</p>


        <li>
            <h3>TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT : </h3>
        </li>
        </p>&nbsp; The mission demonstrated India's technological capabilities in terms of launching
        and operating a mission to the Moon, as well as the complex maneuvers involved in lunar orbit insertion.</p>

        <li>
            <h3>INSPIRATION AND LEARNING:</h3>
        </li>
        <p>&nbsp; Chandrayaan 2 captured the attention and interest of the global community,
            inspiring people, especially young minds, to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and
            mathematics (STEM).</p>

        <li>
            <h3>International Collaboration:</h3>
        </li>
        <p>&nbsp; Chandrayaan 2 involved international collaboration by carrying scientific
            instruments from other countries, showcasing India's willingness to cooperate and contribute to global space
            research.</p>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>MUST READ:</h3>
    <p>&nbsp; While the landing did not go as planned, the Chandrayaan 2 mission is a reminder that space exploration is
        challenging and complex. Failures provide valuable lessons and opportunities for improvement, contributing to
        the advancement of space technology and knowledge. It's also important to recognize that even in the face of
        setbacks, the spirit of exploration and discovery remains strong, motivating scientists and engineers to
        continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible.</p>
